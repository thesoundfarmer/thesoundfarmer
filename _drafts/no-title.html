<p>I finally had a chance to go out and conduct a lengthy spot of recording with my most recent purchases today; a stereo set of DPA 4060s.  I have a couple of parabolic dishes lying about, so I decided to try one of the DPA's out with those.  </p>
<p>Starting out with a custom dish, I had a spot of bother positioning the microphone at the focal point.  The dish has a makeshift handle and I have extended the reach of the microphone mounting point with various bolts and extensions.  However, I have a feeling the shape of the dish (it's quite deep) is affecting how sound is received by the microphone.  I promptly swapped the plastic reflector with a little piece of wildlife sound recording history.</p>
<p>Over a year ago now, I journeyed to Cardiff to collect various items of recording paraphernalia from the sixties; a Grampian parabolic reflector, two Grampian DP4 microphones, adverts, designs and the schematics for the dish, all used 50 odd years ago for BBC wildlife productions!</p>
