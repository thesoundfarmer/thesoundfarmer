<p>My life in sound started in 2009 after commencing a 3 year BA Hons Degree in Sound Design at Ravensbourne. Through networking and word of mouth, Iâ€™ve gained experience in almost all fields of sound, built up an arsenal of recording gear and worked on several high-profile projects. Before moving in to sound I was essentially a farmer (and still am). I lived and worked on a vegetable farm, driving tractors and digging parsnips. I enjoy driving classic cars (particularly my Triumph Herald) and am interested in wildlife.</p>
