<p style="text-align: left;" align="CENTER">I was put in touch with the Greenwich Peninsular Ecology Park.  They were after an audio tour for visitors to the park.  I spent several months at the reserve recording birdsong and ambiences for the tour.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><span>Wednesday 11<sup>th</sup> – Friday 13<sup>th</sup> April 2012: </span></p>
<p align="CENTER"><span>Week One at the North Greenwich Ecology Park</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1008" title="20120412_134305 crop" src="assets/legacy/20120412_134305-crop.jpg" alt="" width="600" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span>For my first recording trip to the ecology park, I was armed </span>with my parabolic dish, omni pair, a Sennheiser 816 hyper-directional mic, Audio Technika AT825 stereo mic, Fostex FR2 LE, and Olympus LS-5 recorder, binoculars, note book and mic stand.  I had hoped to refine this set up over time but it became apparent from the first day that all of the equipment was necessary to carry out my task.</p>
<p><span>I was given a tour of the site to familiarise myself with what wildlife to expect and compile a list of around 20 species of bird to record.  Whether I would suceed in recording everything on the list would be another matter.  So long as I was able to collect a significant number, I'd be happy. The wardens were writing the script for the audio tour, but I had to supply them with a list of recordings before they could start.  As my main targets, the Willow, Reed and Sedge Warblers and Common Terns wouldn't appear until at least the beginning of May, the script-writing process would have to wait.</span></p>
<p><span>To aid the cataloguing and later editing of my recordings I divided my notebook into several categories:  </span>File/Name/Species/Habitat/Mono/Stereo/Microphone Type</p>
<p><span>I had 7 habitats within which to record the different species;</span></p>
<p><span>Inner Lake (East Hide/West Hide)</span></p>
<p><span>Outer Lake/Alder Carr</span></p>
<p><span>Reed beds/Marsh</span></p>
<p><span>Shingle Beach</span></p>
<p><span>Wildflower Meadow</span></p>
<p><span>The Ephemeral Pool/Bat Tower</span></p>
<p><span>The Walk-in Meadow</span></p>
<p><span>Having a Mono/Stereo category was to let me know whether I would have to split channels in the editing process.  I would be recording with the parabolic dish using my omni pair to Olympus LS-5. The LS-5 only records in stereo so I would then have to split the channels in Pro Tools and use the best signal.</span></p>
<p align="CENTER"><span>Wednesday18<sup>th</sup> – Friday 20<sup>th</sup> April 2012:</span></p>
<p align="CENTER"><span>Week Two at the NGEP</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1010" title="20120413_130745 edit" src="assets/legacy/20120413_130745-edit.jpg" alt="" width="600" /></p>
<p><span>The second week at the ecology park was spent waiting patiently in the west hide, waiting for birds to call.  I rigged the Sennheiser 816 to look out over the outer lake and set it off to record any wading birds that may swim by, such as Coots, Morhens, Canada Geese and ducks.  Meanwhile, I would leave the hide with the parabolic dish with omni pair affixed, to record birds in the woodland area.</span></p>

<p><span>I managed to cross off about 8 species from the list, however I wasn't happy with a lot of the recordings.  At the end of each day I would load the files to Pro Tools and remove any handling noise, a common problem with my parabolic setup, aeroplanes and other extraneous sounds from my recordings.  Over the week I whittled around 200 recordings down to about 20 I was happy with.  This trend would continue throughout the rest of the project and there was always a sense of satisfaction once a species was crossed off the list.  I would of course continue to record species I'd crossed off in case a better recording presented itself.</span></p>
<p><span>Most of my recordings were made with a parabolic reflector, a large bowl-shaped construction mathematically proportioned to focus higher frequency sound to a focal point, where the microphone sits.  My recordings suffered from fairly high levels of ambient sound.  To help reduce the ambience, caused mainly by the distant roar of London's traffic and a nearby airport, I applied a high pass filter to each recording to reduce the ambient noise significantly without removing any frequencies produced by the targeted bird.  </span></p>
<p>To be continued.....</p>
