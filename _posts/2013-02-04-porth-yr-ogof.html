<p style="text-align: center;">I spent a weekend in Cardiff in February 2012, meeting up with couple of old school chums.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">When we arrived, we had a choice; stroll up a nearby mountain, or try a bit of potholing. We used to go up mountains a fair bit in Scotland so potholing made a nice change.  Ystradfellte seemed the ideal place to go as it was the location of Porth yr Ogof, "The Mouth of the Cave".</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The site consisted of a river flowing through a valley and into the cave entrance. As we moved into the cave, the sound of the river was totally immersing. The further in we crawled, the lower the cave ceiling to the point my rucksack developed some rather unfortunate holes. The ceiling could only have been three foot high in places. We rejoined the river after further crawling and the cavern opened out.  A shaft of light could be seen in the distance, but aside that the cave was pitch black.  Again, the sounds of the rushing waterflow through the caves was enveloping.  Due to the winter weather, the river was particularly powerful and it stopped us from progressing any further so it was here I set up the sound camp.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">My sound recording kit was limited to the reliable Fostex FR2 LE, my MM-HLSO Micro Sennheiser capsuled omni pair, available from Microphone Madness and for creating an accurate stereo field, a coat hanger.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I spent a good hour recording the flow from different perspectives though a lot of that perspective was lost by the sheer force of the river reverberating through the caverns. I also recorded water leaching through the cave ceiling, trying to fit the omni pair throughout the gaps in the rocks above me in an attempt to collect a trickle's point of view.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">After an hour or two, we decided to return to the surface and follow the river's course further through the valley.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Here is a soundscape created out of some of the recordings I made that day. It follows the course of the River Mellte, it's bubbling brooks, navigating rocks, through the cave system and out again. Definitely best listened to with headphones. Laptop speakers won't do it justice!</p>
