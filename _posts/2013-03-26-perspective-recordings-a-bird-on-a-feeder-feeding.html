<p>"A Bird On A Feeder, Feeding"<br />
Recorded with Sony ECM77-B to MBox 2 to Pro Tools LE8</p>

<p>After attending the "In The Field" symposium at the British Library in February 2013, I'd been inspired to try out a wider range of recording techniques.  Simon Elliott's methods of using wired lapel mics to record the bird's perspective were particularly exciting.  </p>
<p>I made similar recordings a few years ago with spaced omni's but this was a bit different.  I was able to leave the mic for a long period of time without leaving a recorder exposed to the elements or be attacked by wasps.  I was able to run an XLR into the house, plug it straight into an MBox2, press record and go about my business with the sounds of the garden playing indoors.</p>
<p>As this was a test recording and I had lots of other work to be getting on with I was unable to sit and identify the various visitors to the feeder.  However, recently we've been visited by a number of Sparrows, a pair of Robins, two pairs of Blackbirds, Wood Pigeons, a Great Spotted Woodpecker, a Songthrush, Blue, Great and Long Tail Tits, a Chaffinch and a squirrel, so really it could be any of those (although I am disregarding the squirrel in this case.).</p>
<p>Here is one of the spaced omni recordings I made in 2011.</p>
<p>"Agitated Wasps" </p>
<p>Spaced omni's attached either side of the entrance to a wasps' nest above the back door to my house.  Listen with headphones, it's particularly disturbing!<br />
Recorded with MM-BSM-9 Spaced Omnis to Zoom H2</p>
