<p style="text-align: left;">I had the good fortune to be able to offer my services to a production company shooting a short film for the charity Build Africa.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It was a last minute request. I had a week to prepare for the trip, in which time I had to purchase enough batteries for the recorder in case there wasn't any electricity, have my jabs, start a course of malaria tablets, sound operate for four days of night shoots, have two job interviews and fly out for this job. Suffice to say it was a busy week, but if someone asks if you want to go to Uganda, you don't say no! Especially so early in my career as a location sound recordist. And the wildlife opportunities! Blimey.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Flights took the best part of a day, seven hours to Dubai, six hours wait and then about five hours for the next leg of the journey. Arriving at Entebbe airport, it was then a five hour drive to the hotel on a mix of Tarmac and gravel road, thanks goodness in a 4x4.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Shoot Day 1</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I was awoken after about two hours sleep by very strange electronic alarm calls. I wasn't sure what to make of them at first, it didn't sound at all natural. After a bit of confusion I put it down to insects, however the calls would stop and start at exactly the same time as each other as though someone was flicking a switch.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">This was recorded in stereo with an AT825 XY stereo microphone to SD744T.  The calls were produced from insects up in the trees and were the soundtrack to the nights and early mornings.  They'd fall silent at about midnight and start again at around 6am.  I was able to move very close to the insects without them falling silent as the other cicadas would.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The journey to the first location was an hour's drive across Tarmac and dirt track. I kept my eye out for any typical African wildlife on these journeys but the majority of the excitement was drawn by many colourful birds and the occasional lizard.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As set ups and rehearsals were quite a lengthy process, I often had a time to explore my surroundings and seek out new sounds. I attempted a couple of wild track recordings of the crickets but unfortunately left my stereo mic at the hotel. I tried to improvise with a couple of ECM77Bs but I find the mics to have too high self noise to be used for quiet ambiences. In fact I've been finding them a bit too noisy for interviews recently too. I think next on my shopping list are a pair of DPA4060s. Field recordist Jez Riley French has recently started selling them for a good price. They come highly recommended for excellent natural stereo ambience recording.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Anyhow, I went off on my wander joined by one of the local teachers who was keen to show me around and discover the wildlife. Conscious I couldn't wander too far we ended up following the sound of what could have been a very musical bird...</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I had heard one whistling a repeating short merry tune earlier in the day. As we moved closer to the source, it sounded a lot more like someone playing a recorder. It transpired the music was being produced by a small handcrafted single stringed wooden fiddle known as an Idingiti.  At this point I was armed with a Sennheiser 416, hoping to capture some individual species calls instead of ambiences.  I was fortunate enough to be able to position the microphone so close to the instrument, any background sound is almost eliminated from the recording.  I'm very pleased with the capture.<iframe src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F100178382" height="166" width="100%" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The fellow playing it was on his way to church to join the rest of the orchestra. Alas I had no time to record the ensemble as well.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">I'm not sure I can divulge the details of the shoot just yet so I shan't. Suffice to say the first day went very smoothly. Being in the middle of nowhere I didn't have to deal with heavy traffic (aside the odd motorbike, the most common mode of transport) or aircraft. Good clean sound!</p>
