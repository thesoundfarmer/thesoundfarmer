<p>Having a couple of shoots for external clients (i.e not through the studio I work at) in the past couple of months has been quite refreshing and after dealing with radio mics every week for the past year it's been great getting back into the (boom) swing of things!</p>
<p>Last month, I was sound operating on a pleasant short film with a small cast and crew in Hackney Wick and Homerton, two places in London I'd not been before.</p>
<p>The dialog capture was pretty simple, booming with a 416 and recording to 744T. As it typical of London shoots, I was faced with forever changing flight paths and constant air traffic. We were filming pretty close to London City Airport so the issues were understandable if frustrating.</p>
<p>One fairly major sound issue that I wasn't expecting was caused by a lock along the canal we were shooting next to.  The lock has two sets of gates and every time a barge passed through, the operator would leave the alternate gate closed.  The sound of overflowing water would change, altering the ambience of the area.  Recording wild tracks of the overflow from different perspectives will be very beneficial in post production to maintain a consistent atmosphere!</p>
