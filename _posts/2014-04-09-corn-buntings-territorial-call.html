<p>A Male Corn Bunting's territorial call, calling from a telegraph line.</p>
<p>I'm fairly happy with this recording. Â I would be happier without the road noise but I was also contending with a breeze. There was only one position in the field I could record without severe wind noise affecting my microphone and that was facing a country lane!</p>
<p>Corn buntings can be found on open farmland.  The males sing to mark their territories often from high vantage points, in the case of this recording, a telegraph wire.  Male corn buntings are around 19 centimetres long and are somewhat larger than the females.  Corn buntings are dark brown in colour with dark streaks on their bodies and wings, and their beaks are adapted to eating seeds and insects.  They can be found in England and parts of Scotland all year round.  Their territories don't extend to Wales or Northern Scotland.</p>
<p>The RSPB have declared them a Red List Species due to a sudden and rapid decline in numbers in recent years.</p>
<p>Recorded with a single DPA 4060 with Grampian parabolic dish to SD744T on Wednesday 9th April 2014.</p>
