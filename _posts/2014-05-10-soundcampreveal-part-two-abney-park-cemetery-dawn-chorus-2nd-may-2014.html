<p>It was a 2:00am start on Saturday 3rd of May, and the start of the International Dawn Chorus weekend.</p>
<p>I had been referred by a fellow sound recordist to the volunteers of Abney Park Cemetery in Hackney.  They had requested a wildlife sound recordist to record the dawn chorus from the cemetery as part of a live stream for the soundCamp event taking place in South East London. The live stream was to follow the dawn chorus across the world as it was broadcast by recordists across the globe. Resonance FM was to pick up the transmission as were a number of other radio stations.<br />

<p>Setting everything up was rather a last minute affair. I needed a considerable length of XLR to reach as far in to the cemetery as possible, and a suitable means to stream. I found Mixlr the simplest program to use for the stream, particularly as it allowed me to connect my MixPre-D without any hassle and stream with that.</p>
<p>A bit of reconnaissance the evening before revealed the visitors centre, and source of the Internet set back from the park itself, which could prove a problem. I was able to borrow 180 meters of cable from my present employment but I wasn't sure it would be enough. On the day it turned out I was right and my microphones only just reached the more dense woodland.</p>

<p>After a bit of a drive through late-night London we arrived at the park at 3:50am and started rigging. I used two DPA 4060's attached to a coat hanger for good stereo width to MixPre-D to Laptop (and Mixlr) with a feed from the MixPre to SD744T for a backup recording. Even at 4am, the birds had started their calls. My previous visit to the park revealed quite a diverse range of species inhabiting Abney; Greater spotted woodpeckers, Blackbirds, Wrens, Blackcaps, Tawny owls to name a few, but the predominant species calling in the morning were wrens and blackbirds.</p>
<p>I streamed for an hour and half between 4:45 and 6am by which point dawn had well and truly broken. Unfortunately due to a slight mix-up we weren't picked up by the live stream and broadcast, but I re-streamed my recording on Dawn Chorus Day itself and Abney Park and early morning Hackney traffic were broadcast to the world!</p>
