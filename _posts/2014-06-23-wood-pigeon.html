<p>This is a recording of a Woodpigeon, a common sound on the farm.  Woodpigeons appear to have had a very successful year this year.  The other morning I must have heard about ten pigeons coo-ing away happily to themselves.  This particular subject has taken up permanent residence in a laburnum tree in the drive.  There is a nest there, an untidy pile of sticks on a branch where at least one brood have hatched and fledged.</p>
<p>The bird was an ideal subject for close microphone placement.  It's a rather tame bird and after hearing it's call I was able to move close enough to the tree to see where he/she usually sits.  I waited for the bird to move to another song post before setting up a mike.  It appeared to have at least three of these; the tree; the drive gate and a taller tree above the stable.  </p>
<p>I clipped a single DPA4060 omnidirectional microphone on a twig a few centimetres from where the pigeon had been sitting and ran a long XLR back to the house to a MixPre-D and from there via "Tape Out" to an Olympus LS5 recorder.  Upon it's return the pigeon immediately began to call directly into the microphone capsule.</p>
