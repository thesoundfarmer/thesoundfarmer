<p>Here's my second release.  A collection of sounds from the Farne Islands, particularly Inner Farne.<br />
Recorded late July, following three species of seabird nesting on the Islands.  </p>
<p>The absolutely fantastic cover was created by Wildlife Illustrator and Environmental Writer Kate Whittington.<br />
Here's her website:  <a href="http://katewhittington.com/">www.katewhittington.com</a></p>
