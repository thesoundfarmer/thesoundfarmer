<p>It's taken a few years but at last I have a credit on Autumnwatch!  I spent the program in the studio, miking up presenters and guests, watching the program being made first hand. An absolutely fantastic experience I shan't be forgetting. In my opinion it's one of the most important programmes to grace the television with regards to connecting people to the natural world and I'm very glad to have been a part of it. </p>

<p>Long may it broadcast, there's nothing else like it anywhere!</p>
